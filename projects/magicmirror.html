                    <p>So a couple things to note here. If you've never worked with a Raspberry Pi before, getting the starter kit is a safe choice. It comes with everything you need, and there more than enough resources to help you trouble shoot. </p>

                    <p>For the monitor, 24" felt like a good size for me. Any bigger and you would need to buy a bigger sheet of 2 way mirror, a larger IR frame, and more lights(?)! In short, bigger monitor = more money (duh). You could also try to get a touch screen monitor to remove any need to buy an IR frame. Personally, I had a hard time finding a monitor that supported Raspbian OS. I actually initially ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KEEMS1U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1">touch screen monitor.</a> I couldn't get it to work, so I just ended up shipping it back. </p>

                    <p>I actually bought this IR touch screen frame off of <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/?src=sem_ggl&cmpgn=61916163&adgrp=2416352283&fditm=&tgt=aud-55680625111:kwd-11819833088&locintrst=&locphyscl=9032004&mtchtyp=e&ntwrk=g&device=c&dvcmdl=&creative=85572107043&plcmnt=&plcmntcat=&p1=&p2=&aceid=&position=1t1&gclid=CjwKCAjww9_MBRAWEiwAlaMJZlHKkO3DRcYwoaOOssKAyXG0Sk06IxzIJkLd5IK5gHfeGrYSufoBMRoCYGkQAvD_BwE">Alibaba</a>. All the 24" ones on Amazon were easily over $300! I didn't provide a link because the products seem to change URLs quite often. You should be able to find what you need simply by searching {your monitor size} IR Touch Screen Frame.</p>

                    <p>There's not much additional insight I can offer on this. I chose 3mm over a thinner mirror because I wanted it to sit more flush with the monitor frame. Also, any thinner, and I feel like the thing was going to break on me.</p>

                <!-- STEP TWO -->

                <h3>Step 2. Setting Up the Pi</h3>

                <p>The instructions for this step should be provided with your starter kit order. In the case that it's not, here's a quick rundown.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Format your MicroSD card (Raspberry Pi 3 takes a MicroSD, others take a normal SD card, I think).</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Again the starter kit should come with everything you need, including a microSD card reader. In the event that you don't have a reader, you'll want something like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/IOGEAR-MicroSD-Reader-Writer-GFR204SD/dp/B0046TJG1U">this</a>.</li>
                        <li>Formatting instructions on Windows/Mac found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sdxc_formatting.md"> here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Download and extract the files from the NOOBS zip file.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>File found <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Copy the extracted files over to the microSD card.</li>
                    <li>Remove the SD card, and insert it to your Raspberry Pi 3.</li>
                    <li>Power on the Raspberry Pi. You should now be sent to a set-up screen.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If your Pi isn't using the entirety of your monitor, go ahead and head over to <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and uncomment the line that says <code>disable_overscan=1</code>. Now, reboot your Pi by typing <code>reboot</code> in the terminal, or just hit restart. Your Pi should now be in full screen!</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <!-- STEP THREE -->
                <h3>Step 3. Installing Node on the Pi</h3>

                <p>Instructions for this step are taken from DigitalOcean's guide found <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-16-04">here</a>. Here's a quick run-down though.</p>
                <p>From the terminal, type the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><code>$ sudo apt-get update</code></li>
                    <li><code>$ sudo apt-get install nodejs</code></li>
                    <li><code>$ sudo apt-get install npm</code></li>
                    <li><code>$ npm -v</code> and <code>$node -v</code> to verify that at least you get 2.15.9 and 4.6.0 respectively (those are my numbers, but I haven't updated in a while).</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 4. Download the Source Code && Dependencies</h3>
                <p>We're going to use MichMich's Magic Mirror source code, found <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror">here</a>, because it seems like the most popular one, and it's very modular. Of course, at this point, you can just be finished and go ahead to create your own software for this. But what's the point of reinventing the entire wheel? Let's just upgrade our tires.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a directory of your choice, go ahead and type <code>$ git clone https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror.git</code> to copy the project files. You can also fork your own copy of this. Change the clone link, of course.</li>
                    <li><code>cd</code> in to the cloned folder and move <code>config/config.js.sample</code> to <code>config/config.js</code></li>
                    <li>In the project root, type <code>$ npm install</code>.</li>
                </ol>

                <!-- STEP FOUR -->
                <h3>Step 4. Run it!</h3>
                <p>We're almost there! If everything went smoothly, you shouldn't of had scary looking errors during this download process</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go ahead and type <code>$ npm start</code> to start up the mirror. To quit out of it hit <code>CTRL + Q</code>.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>And there you have it! The software should all be working now. If you want to start the program remotely from another computer, check out the next step.</p>

                <!-- STEP FIVE (OPT.)-->
                <h3>Step 5. Setting up SSH (optional)</h3>
                <p>More likely than not, you'll probably want to never plug in a mouse and keyboard to change some code for this mirror after you've mounted it and everything. This is where being able to ssh will come in handy.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Type <code>$ sudo raspi-config</code> in the terminal.</li>
                    <li>Select <code>Interfacing Options</code>.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to and select <code>SSH</code>.</li>
                    <li>Choode <code>Yes</code>, select <code>Ok</code>, and then hit <code>Finish</code>.</li>
                    <li>Test your connection by typing something like <code>$ ssh pi@{your IP}</code> on your local machine (assuming macOS/Linux). Replace that IP address with whatever comes out from typing <code>$ hostname -I</code> on the Raspberry Pi.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Step 6. Building the Frame (In progress)</h3>
                <p>Hey there! Thanks for reading on this far. I'm currently working on this part still. Pictures and instructions for the following steps will be coming soon, so sit tight! (Or feel free to message me).</p>
