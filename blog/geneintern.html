                <h3>// First, Some Background</h3>

                    Let me set the scene here. At the time, I was a second year CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) undergraduate at UC Davis.
                    I spend much of my free time getting tunnel vision from reading <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">r/cscareerquestions</a>,
                    and the rest of the time trying to figure how to get good grades, do meaningful personal projects, and
                    uphold my responsibilities as a club officer for various clubs on campus (shout-out to <a href="http://bcnclub.org">BCNC</a> and <a href="https://daviscsclub.org">DCSC</a>).
                    It's no easy task but it definitely kept me busy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time of applying to Genentech, there wasn't much that I could show off. Sure, I had an impressive resume during high school, but that was relative. The entire game has changed ever since I came to UC Davis.
                    I had a python web scraper that I whipped up in a day or so, and some random C++ programs from school.
                    I also went to <a href="https://hackdavis.io">HackDavis</a> and put a project I made on there on my resume, but none of the projects took more than
                    a full day of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But here's the biggest plot twist of all, none of the work I did at school had a direct relationship as to how I got the internship.
                    So how did I get the position? <strong>Networking</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was well into Spring (March), when someone I knew messaged me to apply to Genentech, and that she could get me an
                    interview. This opportunity was the light at the end of a very dark tunnel of many, many rejections from other companies.
                    With the little hope that I had left, I decided to apply, and see what happens next.
                </p>

                <h3>// Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    After applying, I wasn't sure what to expect. This would have been the first time that I've ever applied through
                    a referral system. I've always heard of people getting referred for internships, but I never really knew how to get one (this is especially difficult for trying to get into a company where you don't know anyone).
                    I suppose I lucked out because next thing you know, I was scheduled for an on-site interview with my future manger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I won't go into too many details about the interview, but I will say that it was a non-technical for a role titled: "Biologics Drug Substance Manufacturing IT" over at Vacaville.
                </p>
