name, email, and message.

### Future Plans / Development
#### Message Wall
- Add additional functionality server side to filter out nasty messages
- Prevent bots from crashing the site (by entering too much data).
#### Blog
- Add an interface for myself to write blog posts without needing to write
any Jade/HTML. Said blogs would be queryed from my MongoDB before rendering a
page.
- Begin working on the tech blog, which focuses on academic-related writing,
or UC Davis specific things.
- Add an anime watch list section
- Add a piano sheet music list
#### Misc
